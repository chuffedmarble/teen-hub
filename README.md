# TeenHub 📱🌍

A community-driven mobile app for teens to share ideas, hobbies, and connect locally.

📖 Project Description

TeenHub is a mobile application built with Expo (React Native) that allows teenagers to share posts, discuss ideas, showcase hobbies, and connect with others in their region in a safe and engaging way.

The app is designed with scalability in mind and follows best practices such as:

Organized project structure

Reusable components

React hooks (useState, useEffect)

Global theme management (Dark Mode)

API integration (Weather, future AI & database features)

This repository currently represents Milestone #1 & early Phase #2, focusing on a strong frontend foundation before full backend integration.
